### <u> Developer Environment </u>

<br>

The goal is to make it easy to quickly create branches to work on tickets from the Kanban board, then merge them into my dev-branch. Once enough tickets have been completed I can do a pull request to the deployed branch (main) and resolve any merge conflicts.

<br>

### <u> Docker </u>

<br>

In future stages I will dockerize this app to make it easy to run in a dev environemnt.
